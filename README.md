**CURRENCY-CONVERTER**


Welcome to my currency converter made it with Java. This my first challenge for the back end specialization 
offered by Alura Latam and Oracle Next Education (Thanks a lot)


**Objetive**


This program use an Api to allow user make exchange between the curriencies
avaiable. (I'll add more currencies later :D).


**Features**


At this moment you can...
1. Make exchanges betwen the curriences showed in the menu.
2. If you finish to consult your exchange you can make another exchange or exit the program.
3. ...(I still working for more features :D)

   
**But... How can I use it?**


(1st Option) Let's to be honest the most easy way is get an IDE compiler, download and extract the zip from this repository, open the proyect and run by the IDE compiler.
(2nd Option) The other way is install java, download the repository, extract and compile one by one the packages.
I recommend you the first option. I'll try to make a package to run just with a click in future updates ;).


**Instructions**


When you are ready with the program open you will first select the currency you want to exchange.

For example if you will change USD Dollars to Mexican Pesos you will select the number 1 option (USD) an then the program will
ask for the currency you want to obtain and you will select the number 2 option.
After of this the program will ask the amount you want to exchange.
